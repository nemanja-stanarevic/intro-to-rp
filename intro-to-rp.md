An Introduction to Reactive Programming
=======================================

There has been a significant shift in recent years towards server-side and
network programming using event-driven asynchronous runtime environments and
frameworks such as Node.js, Twisted, and Netty/NIO. Asynchronous code allows
independent IO operations to run concurrently resulting in efficient code.
However, this improved efficiency comes at a cost - straightforward synchronous
code may become a mess of nested callbacks.

Can we do better? Can we combine the simplicity of synchronous
code with the efficiency of the asynchronous approach? It turns out
we can. `Future` abstraction allows us to express the effect of latency in
asynchronous computation, encapsulate event-handling code, and use higher-order
functions, such as map, reduce, and filter, to compose clean, readable,
asynchronous code.

We will explore this by looking at a web-scraping word count example. First,
we'll write simple synchronous code and consider how this code may look rewritten
with callback-based asynchronous framework such as Node.js or Netty. Then, we'll
use `Promise` to turn callback-based building blocks into functions returning
`Future` allowing us to compose code using functional programming constructs.

While examples are in Scala, the abstractions and patterns described are
applicable to most modern languages. Basic familiarity with functional patterns
is assumed but you can catch up reading [Mary's awesome introduction to functional
programming](https://codewords.hackerschool.com/issues/one/an-introduction-to-functional-programming).


##To Callback Hell and Back

Consider the following example of single-threaded synchronous code:
the `countWordOccurrences` function takes a `List` of URLs and a keyword, fetches
HTML behind each URL, parses HTML into DOM representation, and counts the number
of times the keyword occurs within each page.  It returns a `List` of pairs of
URL and count:

```scala

  def countWordOccurrences(urls: List[String], keyword: String): List[(String, Int)] = {
    urls map { url =>
      val html = fetchUrl(url)
      val dom = parseHtmlToDOM(html)
      val count = countWordOccurrencesInDOM(dom, keyword)
      (url, count)
    }
  }

```

This code is easy to reason about - operations are performed one after another,
in the specified order.  However, this is not very efficient - each `fetchUrl`
call is independent from another and thus easily parallelized, yet this code
executes them serially.  Furthermore, each `fetchUrl` operation involves network
IO and will block the execution thread while waiting for IO to complete.

With callback-based asynchronous approach, the code may look something like this:

```scala

  def countWordOccurrencesAsync(
      urls: List[String],
      keyword: String,
      successHandler: (List[(String, Int)]) => Unit,
      errorHandler: (Throwable) => Unit): Unit = {

    // access to these shared variables would need
    // to be synchronized, adding even more complexity
    var resultsAccumulator = List[(String, Int)]()
    var isUrlCompleted = urls
      .foldLeft(HashMap[String, Boolean]()) {
        (acc, url) =>
          acc.updated(url, false)
      }

    urls map { url =>
      fetchUrlAsync(
        url,
        successHandler = { html =>
          parseHtmlToDOMAsync(
            html,
            successHandler = { dom =>
              countWordOccurrencesInDOMAsync(
                dom,
                keyword,
                successHandler = { count =>
                  // add this result to the accumulator
                  resultsAccumulator = (url, count) :: resultsAccumulator

                  // update state to denote that this url is completed
                  isUrlCompleted = isUrlCompleted.updated(url, true)

                  // check if all urls have been completed
                  // if so, invoke the top success handler
                  val allDone = isUrlCompleted
                                  .map { case(key, value) => value }
                                  .reduce { (a, b) => a && b }
                  if (allDone) {
                    successHandler(resultsAccumulator)
                  }
                },
                errorHandler)
            },
            errorHandler)
        },
        errorHandler)
    }
  }

```

Here, each `...Async` function returns immediately and execution continues while
network IO or other computation is underway.  Callback functions are passed as
arguments to handle cases when operation is successful and when error occurs.
The callbacks are executed once the operation is completed.

This approach allows for more efficient use of system resources, but still has
a number of drawbacks:
 - Need for shared state variables (`resultsAccumulator` and `isUrlCompleted`)
   and synchronization of access
 - Each asynchronous processing step requires a nested callback, quickly leading
   to "callback hell"
 - Code is much harder to read and understand


##Futures and Promises

What is particularly nice about the synchronous code in the first example is that
a function like `fetchUrl` returns a `String` value that other functions in
turn use for their computations.  This leads to easily readable and composable
code.

`Future` allows for similar pattern with asynchronous code. `Future` is an
object that expresses a result of asynchronous computation - a value that is not
available yet but may be available in the future<sup>[1]</sup>. This allows asynchronous
version of `fetchUrl` to return a value of type `Future[String]` which is then
used in synchronous-looking code, without worrying about whether a `String`
value is actually available.

`Promise`s are utility objects that make it easier to construct `Future`s, like so:

```scala

  def fetchUrl(url: String): Future[String] = {
    val p = Promise[String]()
    fetchUrlAsync(url,
       successHandler = { html => p.success(html) },
       errorHandler = { error => p.failure(error) })
    p.future
  }

```

In this example, `fetchUrl` calls the callback-based counterpart `fetchUrlAsync`
with a success handler that completes `Promise p` with success and a failure
handler that completes `p` with failure. The function then extracts a `Future`
out of `Promise p` and returns it to the caller. This "wrapping" of
callback-based code using `Promise` objects to return a `Future` object is a
very common pattern in reactive programming.

The `parseHtmlToDOM` and `countWordOccurrencesInDOM` functions would be
similarly refactored to return `Future[DOM]` and `Future[Int]` respectively.


##Composing Futures and a Way to Map/Filter/Reduce Hell

`Future` trait defines standard higher-order functions such as `map`, `flatMap`,
`filter`, `fold`, and `reduce`. These functions are not exactly the same as ones
defined on `List`, but are similar. For example, `flatMap` defined
on `Future[T]` applies a function that takes `T` as an argument and returns
`Future[S]` and flattens the resulting `Future[Future[S]]` into a single
`Future[S]`<sup>[2]</sup>.  This is analogue to how `flatMap` on `List` flattens `List`
of `List` into a single `List`.

The higher-order functions make it possible to compose functions returning
`Future` using familiar functional programming patterns:

```scala
  import scala.concurrent.{ Future, Promise }
  import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

  def countWordOccurrences(urls: List[String], keyword: String): Future[List[(String, Int)]] = {
    // partially apply countWordOccurrencesInDOM
    val countKeywordOccurencesInDOM = countWordOccurrencesInDOM(_: DOM, keyword)

    // expression evaluates to List[Future[(String, Int)]
    val listOfFutures = urls
      .map { url =>
             fetchUrl(url)
               .flatMap(parseHtmlToDOM)
               .flatMap(countKeywordOccurencesInDOM)
               .map { count => (url, count) } }

    // transform List[Future[(String, Int)] to Future[List[(String, Int)]]
    Future.sequence(listOfFutures)
  }

```

The new version of `countWordOccurrences` simply `flatMap`s the result of
`fetchUrl` over `parseHtmlToDOM` and `countKeywordOccurencesInDOM` and finally
maps the result to a pair of URL and count, resulting in `Future[(String, Int)]`.

The last step is necessary to transform a `List` of `Furture[(String, Int)]`
into a `Future` of `List[(String, Int)]`.

This code appears much cleaner than the callback example.  However, it is
important to note that each function in the above example is defined to take
exact output of the preceding function.  We may not be so lucky with real-world
APIs and we may need to process output a bit before passing it to the next function.
So, it is easy to imagine that real-world code could become much more complicated
with added processing steps. It may even feel like we are simply trading the
callback hell for map/filter/reduce hell.

Finally, reactive code composed with higher-order functions is often not purely
functional â€“ it typically involves side effects through network or file system
IO<sup>[3]</sup>.

So, is there an even better way to write asynchronous code?

##Macros to the Rescue: Async/Await

[Scala Async](https://github.com/scala/async) library provides `async` and `await`
macros inspired by the similar constructs originally introduced by C#. The
macros make it possible to write efficient asynchronous code in direct style,
very similar to how synchronous code is written in the first example.

Basic approach is to wrap each block of asynchronous code within an `async` block
and each computation resulting in a `Future` within an `await` block.  The
computation within `await` block will be "suspended" until the corresponding
`Future` is completed, but in a non-blocking fashion and without any performance
penalties.

```scala
  import scala.concurrent.{ Future, Promise }
  import scala.async.Async.{ async, await }
  import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

  def countWordOccurrences(urls: List[String], keyword: String): Future[List[(String, Int)]] = {
    // listOfFutures evaluates to type List[Future[(String, Int)]
    val listOfFutures = urls
      .map { url => async {
        // html, dom and numberOfOccurences values are of type String,
        // DOM, and Int respectively
        val html = await { fetchUrl(url) }
        val dom = await { parseHtmlToDOM(html) }
        val count = await { countWordOccurrencesInDOM(dom, keyword) }
        (url, count)
      }
    }

    // transform List[Future[(String, Int)] to Future[List[(String, Int)]]
    Future.sequence(listOfFutures)
  }

```

The code above looks nearly identical to the synchronous code from the
first example, reflects programmer's intent more directly, and feels more natural.

##Whatâ€™s Next?

We barely scratched the surface of reactive programming using `Future`, `Promise`
and `async`/`await` constructs.  The upcoming Coursera course [Principles of
Reactive Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive) really digs into
details, incorporates interesting programming exercises and covers two more
reactive patterns that are particularly useful: `Observable` and `Actor`.

`Observable` provides a powerful abstraction over event streams, similarly to
how `Future` provides an abstraction over discrete events.  The most notable
implementation of `Observable` is probably Microsoft's open-source [Reactive
Extensions library](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions).  This library was
used extensively at Netflix to [redefine how they approach both back-end and
front-end development](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/01/reactive-programming-at-netflix.html).
Netflix also put together [a great interactive tutorial that covers use of Reactive
Extensions with JavaScript](http://jhusain.github.com/learnrx/index.html).

`Actor` on the other hand provides building blocks for distributed, fault-tolerant
message passing applications, such as messaging servers, trading systems and
telecom appliances.  The most notable implementations of `Actor` include
[Erlang OTP](http://www.erlang.org/doc/) and [TypeSafe Akka](http://akka.io/).


-----------------------------

[1]: Since the computation may succeed or throw an error, `Future` will either
complete with a value (success) or with an error (failure).

[2]: You don't need to know this to follow the rest of this article, but if you
are curious, here is a sketch of how `flatMap` may be implemented on `Future[T]`:

```scala

  def flatMap[S](func: T => Future[S]): Future[S] = {
    val p = Promise[S]()

    // onComplete method registers a callback that is executed when
    // this Future is completed
    this onComplete {
      // if this Future fails, complete the promise with failure, i.e.
      // propagate failure of "this" Future to the resulting Future[S]
      case Failure(e) => p.failure(e)

      // if "this" Future is successful, evaluate provided function
      // with its result and complete the promise appropriately
      case Success(value) =>
        // apply provided function "func" that returns Future[S]
        val resultingFuture = func(value)

        // register onComplete callback on the resulting Future[S]
        resultingFuture onComplete {
          // if computation fails, complete the promise with failure
          case Failure(e) => p.failure(e)

          // if computation returns a value, complete the promise with
          // the resulting value
          case Success(resultingValue) => p.success(resultingValue)
        }
    }

    p.future
  }

```

[3]: This is why popular "Reactive Functional Programming" term feels like a bit
of misnomer.
